USAGE="USAGE:

    source ./setup.bash [SpArcFiRe Repo Directory]

This script does not change any files, but sets the environment variable SPARCFIRE_HOME to
the base of the SpArcFiRe repo---which is usually just the same directory this
file resides. If you give it an argument, it'll use that directory instead. Otherwise it'll
assume that it's own directory is the SpArcFiRe directory, and all it'll do is echo that
directory.
Note: the 'source' command assumes you're using bash as your shell; if not, you'll need
to figure out how to set the environment variable SPARCFIRE_HOME yourself.
