# Credit for underlying functionality goes to:
# https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2021/02/16/creating-an-image-viewer-with-pysimplegui/

# USAGE: python label_images.py BASE_DIR DIRNAME_FOR_MISLABELED
# BASE_DIR is the directory that houses the pre-labeled images
# in our case, these are the images that pass/fail our verification tests
#
# DIRNAME_FOR_MISLABELED is the directory **inside** BASE_DIR which
# will hold the images which were mislabeled by the verification tests
# i.e. false positive/false negative
#
# On running, an interaction window will pop up with the buttons,
# prev, next, mislabeled. These allow the user to view images in 
# BASE_DIR (jpg only) and either move them to DIRNAME_FOR_MISLABLED 
# via 'mislabled' or continue viewing images via next/prev.
# hint: mogrify -format jpg *.png
# 
# Once all images have been viewed/moved, the window will close.
#
# Known bug: no images on initial run. Must click 'next' to see the second
# image in the set, then 'prev' to view the first before proceeding onwards.
# This is not a high priority but will be fixed eventually.
